    that may help you better understand the following specification:

    What comes in:
      -- An rg.Point.
      -- Two positive integers
      -- An rg.RoseWindow.
    What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
    Side effects:  Draws, on the given rg.RoseWindow:

      -- A VERTICAL rg.Line for which:
           -- Its topmost point is the given point.
           -- Its length is the given length.
           -- Its color is 'black'.
           -- Its thickness is 3.

      -- Several HORIZONTAL rg.Lines such that:
           -- All the horizontal lines have their leftmost point
                on the vertical line.  SEE THE PICTURES.
           -- For the FIRST of these HORIZONTAL lines:
                -- Its leftmost point is the given point.
                -- Its length is the given length.
           -- Each SUBSEQUENT HORIZONTAL rg.Line is  delta  pixels
                directly below the previous rg.Line (where delta is a parameter)
                and 20 pixels longer than the previous rg.Line.
           -- All the HORIZONTAL lines have thickness 3.
           -- The 1st, 4th, 7th, etc rg.Lines have color 'magenta',
              The 2nd, 5th, 8th, etc rg.Lines have color 'cyan'
              The 3rd, 6th, 9th, etc rg.Lines have color 'spring green'

      NOTE: The NUMBER of lines to draw is determined by the facts that:
        -- The vertical line has the given length.
        -- All horizontal lines have their left endpoint on the vertical line.
        -- The distance between horizontal lines is the given delta.

      Must render but   ** NOT close **   the window.

    Type hints:
      :type point:   rg.Point
      :type length:  int
      :type delta:   int
      :type window:  rg.RoseWindow
